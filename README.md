# Rotating Cube example

My first code-venture. A tiny software renderer written from scratch, without using any game engine, or mathematics library. 
Written entirely in Vanilla JS, using the native `<canvas>` element, with some slight shading done on the basis of distance from the camera.
It also does some basic polygon clipping to improve performance.
